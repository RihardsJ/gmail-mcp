# **The 7 Cs of Effective Communication**

**Professional Email Drafting Guidelines for the MCP Server**

## **Overview**

The **7 Cs of Communication** provide a proven framework for ensuring that all email communications generated by the MCP Server are **clear, professional, accurate, and action-oriented**. Adherence to these principles ensures messages are easily understood, reflect organisational standards, and achieve their intended outcomes efficiently.  
These guidelines should be applied to **all automated and assisted email drafting**, regardless of audience or purpose.

**1\. Clarity**

**Ensure the purpose of the email is immediately understood**  
Clear communication minimises confusion and reduces unnecessary follow-up. The recipient should understand the email’s intent within seconds of opening it.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Use a clear, specific subject line that reflects the required action.  
* Write in plain, professional language; avoid jargon and unnecessary technical terms.  
* Keep sentences short and focused.  
* Use bullet points for complex or multi-step information.

**Example**  
**Before**  
Subject: *Meeting*  
Hi team, I wanted to get everyone together to synergize on the Q4 deliverables.  
**After**  
Subject: **Action Required: Q4 Project Planning Meeting**  
Hi team, please join us for a meeting to finalise the Q4 project plan.

**2\. Conciseness**

**Communicate the message using the fewest words necessary**  
Concise emails respect the recipient’s time while maintaining clarity and completeness.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Eliminate redundant or filler phrases.  
* Get to the point quickly.  
* Use a clear call to action (CTA).  
* Avoid repeating information already provided elsewhere unless essential.

**Example**  
**Before**  
At the end of the day, what I’m trying to say is that I think it would be a good idea for us to review the document soon.  
**After**  
Please review the attached document by Friday.

**3\. Correctness**

**Ensure accuracy in content, grammar, and language standards**  
Errors reduce credibility and may cause misunderstandings or operational issues.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Verify all names, dates, times, figures, and references.  
* Confirm the correct spelling of recipient names and titles.  
* Use grammar and spell-checking tools.  
* Ensure spelling, punctuation, and grammar conform to **British English (UK)** standards.

**Example**  
**Before**

**After**

**4\. Coherence**

**Ensure logical flow and consistency throughout the message**  
A coherent email guides the reader smoothly from one point to the next.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Present information in a logical sequence.  
* Group related points together.  
* Use transition phrases where appropriate.  
* Maintain a consistent tone and level of formality.

**Example**  
**Before**  
We need to discuss the budget. The project deadline is next week. Also, remember to submit your timesheets.  
**After**  
We need to discuss the budget to ensure we can meet the project deadline next week. As a separate reminder, please submit your timesheets by Friday.

**5\. Completeness**

**Provide all information required for the recipient to act**  
An effective email anticipates questions and provides everything needed to respond or take action.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Answer who, what, when, where, and how where relevant.  
* Include all necessary attachments, links, or references.  
* Provide sufficient context, especially for new or complex requests.

**Example**  
**Before**  
Let’s meet to discuss the event.  
**After**

**6\. Courtesy**

**Maintain a polite, professional, and respectful tone**  
Courtesy strengthens working relationships and encourages cooperation.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Use appropriate greetings and sign-offs.  
* Include polite expressions such as *please* and *thank you* where appropriate.  
* Frame requests professionally rather than as demands.  
* Be mindful of the recipient’s workload and perspective.

**Example**  
**Before**  
You need to get this report to me now.  
**After**  
I would appreciate it if you could send me the report by 3:00 pm today. Thank you for your assistance.

**7\. Concreteness**

**Use specific, factual, and unambiguous information**  
Concrete communication prevents misinterpretation and supports decision-making.  
**Application Guidelines**

* Replace vague statements with measurable details.  
* Include exact dates, times, locations, and figures.  
* Clearly outline next steps and responsibilities.

**Example**  
**Before**  
The server experienced some downtime recently.  
**After**  
The server was unavailable for 2 hours and 15 minutes last night, from 1:05 am to 3:20 am, affecting approximately 15% of user logins.
