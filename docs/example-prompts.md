# Example Prompts

## Basic Prompts

### Read Unread Emails
```
Show me my 3 most recent unread emails and provide a brief summary of each one, including who sent it and what it's about.
```

### Create Draft Reply
```
Check my unread emails. For the first one, draft a professional reply thanking the sender and saying I'll get back to them by end of week. Keep it friendly and concise.
```

## Advanced Prompts

### Email Triage
```
Look at my 5 most recent unread emails. Categorize them by urgency (high/medium/low) based on the content and sender. Then, draft a polite reply to the most urgent one, acknowledging the request and providing a timeline for response.
```

### Meeting Request Reply
```
Check my unread emails from today. Find any that look like meeting requests. For the first meeting request you find, draft an enthusiastic acceptance reply confirming my availability and asking for the agenda.
```

### Batch Analysis
```
Show me my 10 most recent unread emails. Group them by category (work, personal, newsletters, etc.) and tell me which ones require immediate attention.
```
